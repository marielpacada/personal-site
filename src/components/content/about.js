If you needed living proof that it takes a village to raise a child, you’re looking right at her! Raised in
both Los Angeles and Manila, I am a product of the unwavering love and compassion that my communities have
shown me. I seek projects and experiences that allow me to apply my technical knowledge in promoting social
and cultural enrichment. I hold inclusive design as one of my tenets in life, ensuring that all my work —
whether in accessible web design or transparent data analysis — reflects such.
    <br />

While my bigger dreams are rooted in community empowerment, my other ones hinge on having some plain, old
fun. I enjoy drinking bubble tea, cheering on the Lakers, outpacing my friends on NYT’s daily crosswords,
cooking up Asian fusion recipes, and practicing my tennis serve.

If you share my passion of innovating ways to use tech for social good, especially within Southeast Asian
and Southeast Asian-American communities, I would absolutely love to chat! Please feel free to send a <a
