        <p class="piece-date" style="width: 40%;">apr 5, 2021</p>
        <p id="piece-text">One of my earliest memories is set in 2004 rural Philippines in the bedroom I shared with my
            mother. I recall telling her a story about how I received less than perfect marks on a spelling test because
            I spelled “love” incorrectly as “loev.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Kasi diba yung ‘e’ hindi naman naririnig? Kaya akala ko nasa gitna siya.” <em>You know how you can’t even
                hear the ‘e’ sound? That’s why I thought it was in the middle!</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            I remember feeling like a stand-up comedian at her first show, awkwardly trying to solicit laughs from my
            audience. I wanted to make sure that she didn’t coddle me about my faux pas. Like when a baby hits its head
            and only cries once you make a face suggesting that it’d just hurt itself — I knew that I would start to
            regret my misspelling once my mom showed pity toward me.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Okay lang naman kasi maliit palang ako, diba? Lalaki pa ako, basta mag-aral nalang ako ng mabuti!” <em>It’s
                okay that I made that mistake, right, Mom? Because I’m still young, right? I have my whole life ahead to
                learn and grow, just as long as I study well!</em>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="/images/toddler.JPG" alt="picture of five-year-old mariel">
            <br>
            <i>A picture of five-year-old me that I insisted my mom take because of my cute outfit!</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            I wish I could remember why I said that. Maybe I heard that sentiment from one of my
            instructors and co-opted it as my own, as children do. Or perhaps I really was just wiser as a
            five-year-old than I am now.
            <br>
            <br>
            I don’t know what makes me doubt by capacity for growth these days, but it sure does manifest a great
            departure from my feelings as a toddler all those years ago. I’ve realized that I’m often put off by the
            first mistake I make when I attempt a new hobby or new technology. I’m still learning how to overcome this
            shortcoming, and I think my recent work communicates how much I prioritize this task. I’ve been honing new
            technical skills that I’ve previously avoided because of bad request errors and joining Clubhouse rooms
            ready to ask questions without the fear of seeming like a simpleton.
            <br>
            <br>
            What had been intrinsic to me in the past is something I need to work a little bit harder to internalize
            today — one is guaranteed to learn so long as one stays committed to doing so. Just as I had pushed past my
            initial blunder and eventually learned how to properly spell “love,” I trust that I’ll someday soundly
            crochet a sweater or keep a house plant from wilting. I just need to keep at it, whatever “it’ is, and carry
            Toddler Mariel’s wisdom with me evermore.
